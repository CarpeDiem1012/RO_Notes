# Object Detection in Urban Environment
## 1. Extensive data analysis -- Waymo Dataset
   - the computation of label distributions
   - display of sample images
   - checking for object occlusions.
## 2. Decide data augmentations
## 3. Train NN to detect and classify
## 4. Monitor with TensorBoard
   - decide when to end the training
## 5. Experiment with hyperparameters -> improve model performance

> Use TensorFlow ObjDet API for Deployment and create a short video for predictions

> You must manually save Jupyter notebooks before switching on or off the GPU, or else you may lose that work.
